int arr[5]={2,8,18,34,5}; 
char ch[6]=”abcde”; 
cout<<arr<<endl; 
cout<<ch;

 
What output will you get in each line(address is printed or something else)? Why so?



cout << arr << endl; will print the address of the first element of the integer array arr.

cout << ch; will print the string "abcde".

This is because arr is a pointer to the first element of the array, while ch is a null-terminated character array, which cout handles as a C-style string.
