The code will not show an error. 
This is because i[arr] is equivalent to arr[i] due to the way array indexing works in C++. 
In the expression i[arr], i is treated as a pointer to the start of the array, and then arr is the offset.
Therefore, the code will correctly print the elements of the array.
